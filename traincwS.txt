micro usb supported ram management good, always take 850 900 mb ram 1gb. need clear frequently.
This phone is not for music lovers loud speaker clarity is average but its very loud. Also listening songs through headset is also of average qulaity. This is were this phone really lags behind other phones in this price range.
Phone get easily heats up while playing heavy games like Asphalt8, Nova3, RealRacing etc.
Screen has some yellow tint on some models. Its really annoying when we see a white backround/picture
Camera quality is very poor in indoors. 
No FM
No Infrared 
Both are not cons. But i would say desirable features.
Headset provided is not that great. Just given for the sake of giving.
Charger provided is very slow. It takes 3 hours for phone to go from 5% to 100%. Also, there is no usb cable provided. I use my let's charger to charge the phone as it charges the phone in 1.5 hours max.
Whatsapp notification is very bad. It shows the read message again in notification bar. I dont know if its app issue or windows issue.
The phone lags sometimes while disconnecting call. Yes, you've read it correctly. It lags sometimes while disconnecting callst its not that much of a biggie for me.
The main issue which i have is the phone looses the network connection in weak areas and sometimes it fails to get it back. I have to restart my phone to get the network back. Putting it in airplane mode and back also does not help. Again, this I am not sure if it is the problem to my particular device or OS issue.
Last but not the least, if you rely too much on Gmail then you have to get adjusted to windows mail app. Though it syncs the gmail, it will not categorize it in promotion and social folder so you have to see all emails. There are third party apps but still they require lot of work. FYI, i use Metromail. Again, this con is only for my personal experience and it may differ from users to users. 
Camera is ok and not that great.The low light performance of the camera is bad and even the daylight pictures come too grainy. Front facing camera is good for calls. 
Worst touch. It lags much
Battery very poor. You will regret if you purchase this product
Camera not looks like 8 MP in fact 5 MP
Worst performance.
Battery draining faster(when i kept full charge in night it is showing 70% of charge now with out any usage ,without wifi.
display icons are pixalated.(you can not find clear icons)
Touch is slow
unnecessary vibrations you cant keep it in normal mode when messages arrives it always vibrates.
call quality is louder that your frient can hear your conversation with out speaker
heats up faster.
OTA update : Not available
Music : 6/10 Just a Normal music like every other device.(Has shifted from HTC beats audio to normal OnePlusOne music)
Camera : 6/10 Rear camera is not a true 13 megapixel it is like 5 megapixel of my last HTC device.Front camera is good.
OS Version : Has told on flipkart that it will come with lolipop but found on Kitkat.
MultiUser not present
bloatware ( I have uninstalled few ,but some are sticky ) 
No protective screen ( something like Gorilla Glass) ( Personally I feel this should be there with charges accordingly ) 
Feel charging via a computer USB port is little slow ( need to check again )
Delay in software update always.
Software issue is a big problem in one plus one.
Battery drains with in 6 hrs,no use of 3100mah battery.
Single sim use less in india
Heats like iron box.You can do your t shirt iron.
Crashed every time for every application
No sign of software update for camera
Everybody saying its a good camera mobile,but i used samsung mobiles,my Samsung mega 5.8 camera was beautiful and the details i got in mega ,you can't expect in one plus one.
Too much grains in day light camera pics,no use of camera if you are a photo frick.
Touch screen issue persists after the software update also. 
The display is a big let down,not great .Lumia 730's Amoled is best display in windows phone till now ( comparing with 540,640 and 830) I would rate display 2.5/5
The touch is many times unresponsive,still Lumia 730 has better touch(This time only 540 and 640)
Minor lags while opening whatsapp and some other apps 
No USB cable available. There is a charger, not like the ones you ll get an adaptor and cable.
No control buttons in headphone.
Charger is heating up while the phone is in charge
Noticed the rear side heating up while playing some high end games (mortal kombat, fifa 15, asphalt 8) though not to a greater extent, but noticeable. (Played for around 1-2 hours)
I don;t know how many users have used this feature, but in android phones have a feature where you can pull the contacts by typing number from dialpad (lets say I have a contact prem, opening the dial pad in android and if I press numbers 773 I will get suggestion from contacts) - It may be fixed in windows 10.
Earphones are only good for calls, nothing extra ordinary. Better get a new one for music.
No data cable in the box.
Cortana not yet available in India.
Poor front facing camera quality. Nearly grey scale in indoor lightning conditions.
Rear camera quality is little grainy in Indoor condition.
No ear phones inside
Phone build is average
Touch sensitivity is less
It runs on KITKAT version of android .(Lollipoop not yet released for this phone )
The mobile application was not tested properly. Many spelling mistakes.
Mobile data not connecting. working only when you restart. 
Mobile not unlocking even after entering correct PIN. 
In Message, It shows number instead contact name.
You can see message received alert but it not showing messages.
Heating issue
Please dont buy this phone.
First bad cameral quality. The Company claims it to be 8 MP. But the picture quality is worse than 3 MP.
Viewing angle of screen is also very bad. If you tilt the phone a bit upside dowm, picture will be in negative.
As this mobile comes with 1GB of RAM, xiomi OS it self consumes 700MB data and u will only left with 300MB, In that if u run FB, watsapp, truecaller and one more app which general to use parallel. system go un responsive for few seconds and It kills app by it self. so there is killer from OS which removes running apps if memory dries. This is very very bad. I just manage with wats app and one more.
but there is an option we can c the currently running app and we can kill the apps that we are no more using. so u should make sure u have left some RAM to get good response.
If you use this mobile for heavy gaming or social media apps which consumes lot Data then battery will dry. 
I don't know what is the problem, but I am not able to receive any messages instantly on whatsapp, messages are getting delayed.
You may find difficult to work with MIUI
No headphones in the box
No backlit buttons
Speaker on back near camera, so you might not hear clearly when phone is kept on table.
cheap look.
Touch screen sensitivity is too bad.
No free RAM available after installing few applications like viber, skype, etc
The camera is for name sake, the quality do not match 8MP. 
Actually there is no discount is provided by flipkart as the MRP of the mobile itself is Rs. 4999.
The ear piece area is getting heated up if you talk more than 5mins.
No Headset or screenguard provided in the BOX. Moreover there are no accessories available in the market like flipcover.
con:
i have both a7000 and k3 .what i notice is that screen color is more towards the colder side in k3 i.e white will look more like bluish white in this.( i would have preferred more neutral tone but screen clarity and viewing angle is awesome)
charging time is a big problem. (battery 2900)
speaker sound is shit in both the phone.u will find problem to hear the voice through the phone earpiece if u are at some busy place.(call quality is less on our side)
ram available is less in k3 compared to a7000.(though this never affected the performance)
network signal strength in a7000 and k3 is comparatively less than the other phones it fluctuates a lot which never happened with my moto g or samsung basic phone.(but again till now i dont have face any problem of no network but consider this fact also that i live in central mumbai )

reboots in between calls,

Unresponsive touchscreen and ghost touches
Camera in night
Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level
Requires too much time for charging too much time for charging 
THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IN IN DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING IS TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS IN A HALF LIT ROOM.
JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS BY ONE POINT AND EVERY THING IS FINE.
NO DLNA AND NFC.
NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC.
LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL IN EARS.
Little bit Slippery from hands and Cant hold it in One hand if your hands are small.
No inbuilt Call recording feature Which we get it in Asus . 
Low internal memory(This would be the only Concern that many would think to buy Yureka as it Comes with 16Gb and 12.7 user available)
No Backlit !!! but its okay we are human beings we get "used too" very easily ;)
No headphones you need to buy one 
Charging takes 2hrs 30 mins approximately
No OTG Support as of now.
No lolipop OS Update 
No headset 
8GB internal memory (4.69Gb) user available and all apps are easily move to sd card. 
No OTG support (big less for me)
No Led back light for navigation keys
Built in battery ( I am ok with that since I have a good powerbank)
Heating if I use the phone while charging ( I am not a game freak so did not test while gaming.)
Little over priced when compare to competitors (ie Redmi note.Yu yureka)
Lack of accessories availability now
No head phones included ( few lucky people got limited edition package with Headphones and 3000mAh Huawei power bank) 
No Cornig gorilla protection for screen
Internal Memory: Very low internal memory will be provided. Out of 8GB, only 3.8 will be available for the user. 
No Gorilla Glass.
No USB OTG 
The capacitive touch buttons are not backlit.
Internal Memory: Very low internal memory will be provided. Out of 8GB, only 3.8 will be available for the user. You gotta buy an SD card and you can install apps directly on it.
Performance: The OS lags a bit. For me this is not an issue, I was looking for a phone with good hardware under 10K and I made a right choice. Only thing which annoyed me was in Whatsapp. If you type long/bulky text messages, the phone becomes slow in reading the input.
Build Quality: After removing the back panel and putting it back, the phone started to make creaking noises while operating the phone. I think only I'm facing this issue as none of the other users who have given reviews here didn't mention about it. To overcome this issue, I bought a case for this phone. Now the creaking noise is stopped completely.
No Gorilla Glass.Be very careful in handling this device.
No "Double tap to sleep"
The capacitive touch buttons are not backlit. Operating this device in the dark will be a hassle. 
No USB OTG (I personally don't care about this) 
When the device is held on Landscape mode (Horizontally) while gaming, hands will block the speaker vents.
Slow charging and the 2pin wall adapter heat a lot while charging.
No headphones.
inbuild memory only 4gb.
Back light.
Primary camera not good: After listening 13 MP, i was in the dreams of pics that I could take. But my expectation wentoff. Much noise is there, when you are taking pics, specially without flash. This disappoint me.
A bit heavy and large to hold.
No headphone in the box. You have to buy your own.
