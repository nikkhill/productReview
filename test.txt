Hello Friends!!!! I purchased Redmi Note 4G from Flipkart about 2 months ago. I have been using this phone as my secondry phone for 2 months. My primary phone is Xiaomi Mi4. I am very experienced in gadgets. I have Mi4, Redmi Note 4G, Mi pad, Redmi 1s, Nexus 7 and One Plus One.
Friends are you hesitating to buy this phone because it is a CHINESE phone and you have nevr hear of the company before? Do not worry friends, this was the same case with me. However when I first purchased Redmi 1s, it was the best phone ever. Xiaomi also has service centers all over India.

So, Friends here is my review-

--------------------------
LOOK AND FEEL
-------------------------
The black front face is offset by a shiny white rear shell and very noticeable red icons for the three capacitive buttons below the screen.The whole look is pretty understated. There's only a small silver Mi logo on the lower back and no branding on the front. The buttons are lined up on the right edge, while the left is blank. The headset socket is on top and the Micro-USB port is on the bottom. Xiaomi uses a non-standard squared-off Micro-USB port which makes it difficult to see which way the plug needs to go in.The rear shell is a bit difficult to pry off, but the first major difference between the Xiaomi Note twins is visible beneath it. The 4G version of this phone has only a single regular-sized SIM card slot. You still need to take out the battery in order to swap SIM and microSD cards.As far as phones with 5.5-inch screens go, the Redmi Note 4G isn't all that difficult to handle. It's reasonably wide and tall, but you'll definitely feel its weight and you'll have to balance it carefully in order to reach all parts of the screen with one hand.

---------------------------
SPECIFICATIONS
--------------------------
The Redmi Note 4G shares most of its specifications with the Redmi model, with one key difference. While the previous model was based on an octa-core MediaTek MT6592 processor, the 4G version uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400. The main reason for this is Qualcomm's integrated LTE capabilities, but there's a very interesting side effect in India. Thanks to legal hurdles brought on by a patent infringement dispute with Ericsson, Xiaomi has been restrained from selling MediaTek-based products in the country. A Qualcomm version allows the company to keep selling this product in India while the case is being heard.The screens on both models are the same 5.5" 720x1280 panels, and there's still 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage space. MicroSD capacity support has been bumped up to 64GB, and there's faster Wi-Fi 802.11ac support.The 13-megapixel cameras are also identical, as are the Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and FM radio features. Both models have accelerometers, gyroscopes, digital compasses and proximity sensors. The 3,100mAh batteries also appear to be exactly the same as Redmi Note 3G.

----------------------------
SOFTWARE(MIUI)
----------------------------
Xiaomi's MIUI skin is one of the most polished we've seen from the major Chinese manufacturers. As we've come to expect, all icons and widgets live together on the homescreens and there is no separate app drawer. This is something users who like simplicity might prefer, but we feel hampered because it's difficult to arrange widgets, and as we install more apps, things get really disorganised.The system app icons are also customised, and thankfully they aren't too difficult to tell apart. Everything looks crisp and clean, without being over the top. Xiaomi includes an online wallpaper catalog within the Settings app itself. You can change the transition animation and some other visual effects if you like.There are quite a few options to discover in the Redmi Note's Settings app. You can play around with settings for the buttons, notifications LED, lockscreen and more. There's a massive variety of ringtones and message alert sounds to choose from. The notifications shade is also clean, and you can choose whether to show quick settings shortcuts in a separate page or in a scrolling bar at the bottom.

-------------------------
PERFORMANCE
-------------------------
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G did not feel any different to use than the earlier model did, and users should be quite happy with the way this device handles everyday tasks. We had no trouble running common apps and light games.. The Redmi Note 4G consistently performed just a little bit slower than the original Redmi Note did. We've seen devices with Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 400 and MediaTek's octa-core MT6592 go head-to-head before, but never two that were so closely matched in all other regards. The MT6592 usually has an advantage in CPU-intensive tasks but loses out in the graphics department. However in this case, the Snapdragon 400 lagged behind across the board.

--------------------------------------
BATTERY AND CAMERA
--------------------------------------
( I have attached pics clicked with Redmi Note 4G with the review. You can check them out to get an idea)

The relatively power efficient processor and big battery (3100 mAh) gives the Note 4G excellent battery life. When used to access two social media accounts, two email accounts, web browsing for nearly an hour, calls for nearly an hour, some gaming and little of photography, the phone lasts around 14 hours. For most users, it is safe to say that it will give a battery life of around 16 to 18 hours.

The Note 4G packs in a very good rear camera. It clicks 13-megapixel images and when used in daylight, it clicks photos that sharp, clear and have good colours. The level of detail is less than what we usually expect from a 13-megapixel camera but keeping in mind the price of the phone, we have to say that it does well. The colours in images are punchy, especially if you have taken care of holding the phone steady and if the light is good. In low light, the performance is not so good but it is also not terrible. In low light if you hold the phone steady while clicking an image, you will be able to snap photos that you can share on social media.

------------------------------------------------------------
SHOULD YOU BUY IT? ABSOLUTELY!!
-------------------------------------------------------------
At a price of Rs.7,999 the RedMi Note 4G is an excellent value for money. It is a capable device and offers very good smartphone experience at a very nice price point. The UI is also very stable and Xiaomi also Promises future software updates. ( I just updated my Redmi Note 4G to MIUI 6)
The Note 4G is a perfect choice. It is a safe buy if you are looking to get a smartphone for less than Rs.10,000. This is the best smartphone you can buy at such a low price!!!!
Seriously guys I am using this phone past 7 days and was amazed to see that even if you play heavy games from day 1, you won't find your phone getting heated or battery drainage. The only time it gets heated when you keep it on charging for the first time because it is the case with every Android phone. Now about specs 2gb Ram is enough for playing modern combat or fifa 15. You can find such phones being sold by Samsung and Sony at 30 to 35 K. Internal 8 gb might be less for people who keep their phone stuffed but then you havean advantage of rooting the phone without losing its warranty. Sound is good with my Nokia and Philips SHE3900BK hradphones. Camera quality is also good with a feature called age detecter. And if you are a new MI user, you'll be in love with its boxing.
Pros:
1. Price .
2. Battery back up.
3. Butter smooth Swipe.
4. Music player come with good settings like shake to change song, headphone configuration etc.
5. No lag on playing high end games.
6. The front camera is very good for selfie.
7. It has better build quality, screen display, touch sensitivity, cameas, speakers, CPU-RAM-operating system-interface-battery backup
combination
8. Several new and unique features, tools, and Apps are there. Its easy to control this device.
9. Light weight
10. Its affordable, reliable, and highly recommended. It feels great having it.

Cons:
1. Single Sim slot
2. The 720p HD display is good but not great with 5.5 inch screen.
3. Not very suitable for rough-use, and needs a bit of careful handling
4. LED flash may not be very effective under presence of other sources of light like daylight.
5. Apart from the charger and the USB cable, no other accessory( like screen-guard, flip-cover, SIM-adapter, etc.) are provided with this mobile handset.
6. 4G service is unavailable in many places in India. So 3G is used easily
7. Charging time: Since the battery is huge so it take a large time to charge. Almost 3 hours from 0 to 100%.

Thanks for reading my review and bearing my thoughts..
Have a good time..!

4.0 out of 5 stars At this price its even BETTER! [+UPDATED 09-JULY-2015], 1 July 2015
By Abraham - See all my reviews
(TOP 10 REVIEWER)   
This review is from: Karbonn Machone Titanium S310 (Blue) (Electronics)
Karbon Machone is a complete package with such a low price tag.Most people don't wanna buy this phone because it is a Karbonn branded phone and they actually don't trust the brand and its quality.But the actual experience with the phone is somewhat different.Karbonn may not be a well known brand but they have better after sales service than most of the local smartphone brands.
I have got a chance to use the phone for a week and here's my review.I would try to keep it clean and simple.

?Design:A great looking phone for such a budget price.Even though the entire casing is plastic the build quality is pretty great.the front earpiece are metallic.The touch capacitive buttons are back-lit.The hands-on experience is pretty premium and it is light enough.
?Display:4.7 IPS HD Display makes it a premium one at this price.The viewing angles may not be that great but is enough.
And its perfect for single handed usage.
?Camera:Its an other selling point of this device with 8MP+5MP camera pair.
The 8MP backshooter really takes good shots with nice details.And the color reproduction is better than most in the same range.
The back-illuminated sensor makes it capable of capturing excellent low light images.But make sure to keep the phone still, while low lightshots
The front snapper can take great selfies.
?Performance:Can run most of the high end games with ease.Tried playing temple run,real racing and some small games and it really handles it nicely. Haven't noticed any kind of heating.I also tried playing the GT-racing 2 with full graphics and the device struggle a bit while race beginning.
?Battery:Good enough but not great.The low capacity battery can give you a pretty good battery backup for the budget price.[5000MAh power bank recommended.]

UPDATE 09-JULY-2015
-----------------------------------

?Did some Benchamarking:
An Tutu -18542
Multicore score-1300
Powerboard score-34
Base mark gaming -4750

?Also did some gaming-Played asphalt 8,real racing,Traffic racer,Dead trigger 2 and some other games.And it did handle the games with ease.but i have noticed some lag in Modern combat 5 though its still playable.
?About heating:Yes! it does get a little hot at sometimes on extensive gaming but still i don't think its a deal breaker.
Phone is just awesome.......no lags at all.
Camera quality is also good. Dont believe on the fake reviews that it heats up a lot as if its temperature is from 25 to 28 degree.
Sound in earphone is also clear and surround.
At loudspeaker is crisp and clear.
I bought it at price of 5000 and its really value for money phone.
Its too slim as if like iphone 6 design.
I am fully satisfied with this phone except it battery life. On 3g it runs for 6 hours and on wifi it runs for 7-8 hours. Its selfie camera is just mind blowing and screen quality is beat at its price with ips hd screen. Grab it ............

2. Heating issue
3. Games like asphalt8, smash hit when started phone hand and only solution remaining is removing battery

ATTENTION CUSTOMERS ; !!!!

Yeah offcourse good features in low price but!!! YOUR HEALTH IS AT RISK
I BOUGHT IT 9 /07/15 AND FOUND THAT SHOCKING REALITY ;; IT IS CAUSING AN IRRITATION TO HEART AND BRAIN WHENEVER I USE IT IF FEEL MY HEART BEAT LOWERING ALONG WITH HEAD ACHE

PLEASE CONSIDER THIS BEFORE BUYING YOUR HEALTH IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF ANY HARMFULL RADIATINS FROM THIS WORST EVER PHONE '" KARBONN'
Really amazing product i bought for my son.
He is very happy now and fully enjoying with this value for money model
Thanks Karbonn.
Camera is disappointing both Front & Rear....very average & with regular SIM slot had to change the SIM from micro to regular to check the full feature of the phone.....also hangs once in a while....touchscreen not very responsive.....with no flip cover at this price point for a 3G phone feels slightly highly priced ....price should have been @ 4000/- ........overall average smartphone....there are plenty of options in the market at 4999/-
Purchased on 4th Jul 2015, using since 3 days and experiencing very good performance, very slim and light weight, good display, fare battery life last long for 12 to 14 hrs, value for money, best at its price range
Amazing phone.. The features are mind boggling,the front cam and its flash in particular are awesome!!! But... the heat generated when backcover is put, is an issue that needs some attention.. and ofcourse the battery... though decent, needs a power bankif you want to enjoy uninterupted entertainment.... Else, mentally prepare yourself to charge it atleast twice a day if not thrice....

Performance: Awesome,no lags and a slight bugs i found in the ZEN UI...i think that can be ignored..CPU heats a slight while using continous 3G(i guess it's the issue with many phones)...But less heating compared to Yureka...

Zen UI: I have used Cyanogen OS and MIUI, I think Zen UI also has customiztion features like them..for eg.Themes,scrolling effects,and the quick settings,gestures(double tap one is awesome)...So overall it was a good experience on Zen UI also..
There are some very good features: one hand operation mode in which the display becomes suitable for using us with one hand..even left hand person can use this feature..
Reading Mode,vivid modes,floating calculator etc are some of the features i overcame..

Display: Display is brilliant...in this price range no doubt for that...!(i haven't tested in sunlight)

Loudspeaker: I found it loud..but... when we hold in our hand the loudspeaker gets covered..so it was not a good placement for the loudspeaker

Volume rocker:It's an awesome placement of button...very handy..while taking selfies..and muting the alarm,calls.

Camera:it is good but not excellent...in this price range..its the best...it has great filters and modes:GIF animation,time rewind,smart remove etc...which we wont find in this budget...overall it surpasses the Yureka and redmi's camera..(i haven't tested it in low light either..so can't tell about that)

Build:Quality is best..though the back is plastic it feels like metal..it is just a normal brushed aluminium finish on a plastic case..which feels great and stylish..

CONS:i found the ram usage a bit high when the phone is idle..it crosses 55%..sometimes..
Few bugs in ZEN UI ...which can be fixed in small OTA update..
camera is satisfactory or you can say above average..the phones in this range with 13mp camera are giving a grainy,non-superfine image..
and i thought this model comes with a fast charger but it doesn't..disappointing..!
and the lock button placement is not at all handy..i have set the double tap technique to overcome this issue..!
